/**
 * The app in two languages, without a library.
 *
 * What a translation layer has to do here is small: look a key up in one of two
 * JSON files, put a number or a name into the gap, and fall back to English
 * rather than showing a person `udhaar.summary.payable`. That is thirty lines.
 * A library would add a dependency, a build step and a plugin config to do the
 * same thing, and this app already decided against carrying weight it does not
 * use.
 *
 * WHERE THE CHOICE LIVES
 *
 * Three places, in order of authority:
 *   the signed-in profile   travels with the person across devices
 *   localStorage            so the login screen is already in their language,
 *                           before there is a profile to read
 *   English                 for someone who has never chosen
 *
 * The profile wins once it loads. Until then the stored preference is used, so
 * the first paint is not in the wrong language and then flipping.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEVER TRANSLATED
 *
 * Anything stored. Category ids, statuses, modes, amounts, and above all the
 * words a person typed themselves - a note, a person's name, a custom category.
 * Those come back exactly as written, in either language.
