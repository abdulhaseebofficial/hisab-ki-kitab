/**
 * The two dashboards, and the ways they must differ.
 *
 * The failure this guards against is the cheap one: shipping the same screen
 * twice with different words on the tiles. So these check what each dashboard
 * *asks*, not just what it says - a student is asked how much is safe to spend
 * today, a household is asked how much of the month is already committed - and
 * that the groupings underneath are actually different sets of categories.
 *
 * They also pin the arithmetic that must never be invented: with no income
 * recorded, there is no honest per-day figure to show.
